# Diffusing Ideas
## Software, noise and building mathematical toys

_Diffusing Ideas_ is a book of research exploration and software development which we have written for the interest of mathematically-inclined programmers and computational scientists. It's the output of many interrelated projects over several years which have sought to generalise the computational mathematics of simulating, statistically inferring, manipulating and automatically controlling stochastic phenomena as far as possible.

**Co-authored by:** Robert J. Hardwick and C. M. Gomez-Perales

This repository contains the LaTeX code for the book which is very much a work-in-progress.
