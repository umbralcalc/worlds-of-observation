# Diffusing Ideas
## Software, noise and building mathematical toys

_Diffusing Ideas_ is a book of research exploration and software development which we have written for the interest of mathematically-inclined programmers and computational scientists. It's the output of many interrelated projects over several years in which we have sought to generalise the maths and code behind simulating, statistically inferring, manipulating and automatically controlling stochastic phenomena into a unified framework.

**Co-authored by:** Robert J. Hardwick and C. M. Gomez-Perales

This repository contains the LaTeX code for the book which is very much a work-in-progress.
