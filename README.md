# Worlds Of Observation
## Building more realistic environments for machine learning

_Worlds Of Observation_ is a book about building software environments for training machine learning algorithms to control ‘noisy’ systems in the real world. While model-free reinforcement learning is a popular and very powerful approach to generating such algorithms (especially when there is plenty of data and the system is fully observable), this book is better suited to creating algorithms using a more model-based approach. Those readers who are data scientists, research engineers, statistical programmers or computational scientists may find our mathematically descriptive, yet practically-minded, approach in this book quite interesting and a little different to the usual perspectives.

This repository contains the LaTeX code for the book which is very much a work-in-progress.
