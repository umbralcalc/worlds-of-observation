\chapter{\sffamily Algo-trading on financial markets}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} The idea here is to use the Q-Hawkes processes and the Bouchaud work to come up with some interesting simulations of financial markets. 

\textcolor{red}{
\begin{itemize}
\item{Full sim: fully individual agent-based stochastic model for limit order book}
\item{Inference model: Q-Hawkes process inference features using the probabilistic reweighting }
\item{Maybe also try amortized inference-based full sim inference.}
\end{itemize}
}

\textcolor{red}{
\begin{itemize}
\item{Fundamental simulation should be that of a proper limit order book microsim~\cite{bouchaud2018trades}}
\item{Algo trades using online learning of the market dynamics through Q-Hawkes processes} 
\end{itemize}
}
