\chapter*{Introduction}

Written for the mathsy programmer or computational scientist, \emph{Diffusing ideas} records a journey of research exploration and software development over several years. It's the output of many interrelated projects, focused on generalising the computational mathematics for the simulation, statistical inference, manipulation and automated control of stochastic phenomena as far as possible. As a consequence, the book accompanies a lot of new open-source scientific software written predominantly in the \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python} and \href{https://go.dev/}{Go} progamming languages. This software is still in development. 

My main motivation for developing these new computational tools is to prepare a core collection of modules to use as a foundation for developing new and more complex applications. I also hope that the resulting framework will enable anyone to explore and study new phenomena effectively, regardless of their scientific background.

The need to properly test all this new code has also provided a wonderful excuse to study and play with an extensive range of mathematical toy models. I've chosen these models based on my broad background of interests, but also to illustrate the remarkable cross-disciplinary applicability of stochastic processes. However, it's often true that mathematical formalities can obscure the computations that a programmer must tell their machine to do. So, while I have tried to be as ambitious as possible with the level of technical sophistication in these models, I've also written most of the expressions in a way so as to make their intended computations as explicit as possible.\footnote{E.g., think matrix instead of operator.} 

A quick note on the software; any software that I describe in this book (including the \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/diffusing-ideas}{software which compiles the book itself}) will always be shared under a \href{https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT}{MIT License} in a public Git repository.\footnote{The repositories will always be somewhere on this list: \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc?tab=repositories}{https://github.com/umbralcalc?tab=repositories}.} Forking these repositories and submitting pull requests for new features or applications is strongly encouraged too, though I apologise in advance if I don't follow these up very quickly as all of this work has to be conducted independently in my free time outside of work hours.

No quest would be complete without a guide, so to end this introduction, I think it makes the most sense to outline the key milestones and their motivations within the context of the overall research project. My core aims, which comprise the four major parts of this book, are answers to the following set of interdependent research questions:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2.5\parindent] 
\item[{\bfseries\sffamily Part 1.}]{How do we simulate a general set of stochastic phenomena?}
\item[{\bfseries\sffamily Part 2.}]{How do we then learn/identify the answer to {\bfseries\sffamily Part 1} from real-world data?}
\item[{\bfseries\sffamily Part 3.}]{How do we simulate a general set of control policies to interact with the answer to {\bfseries\sffamily Part 1}?}
\item[{\bfseries\sffamily Part 4.}]{How do we then optimise the answer to {\bfseries\sffamily Part 3} to achieve a specified control objective?}

\chapter{\sffamily Building a generalised simulator}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} To design and build a generalised simulation engine that is able to generate samples from a `Pokédex' of possible stochastic processes that a researcher might encounter. A `Pokédex' here is just my fanciful description for a very general class of multidimensional stochastic processes that pop up everywhere in taming the mathematical wilds of real-world phenomena, and which also leads to a name for the software itself: the `stochadex'. With such a thing pre-built and self-contained, it can become the basis upon which to build generalised software solutions for a lot of different problems. For the mathematically-inclined, this chapter will require the introduction of a new formalism which we shall refer back to throughout the book. For the programmers, the public Git repository for the code that is described in this chapter can be found here: \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex}{https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex}.

\section{\sffamily Computational formalism}

Before we dive into the software and some examples, we need to mathematically define the general computational approach that we're going to take in order to be able to describe as general a set of stochastic phenomena as possible. From experience, it seems reasonable to start by writing down the following formula which describes iterating some arbitrary process forward in time (by one finite step) and adding a new row each to some matrix $X' \rightarrow X$
%%
\begin{align}
X^{i}_{t+1} &= F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) \,, \label{eq:x-step-def}
\end{align}
%%
where: $i$ is an index for the dimensions of the `state' space; $t$ is the current time index for either a discrete-time process or some discrete approximation to a continuous-time process; $X$ is the next version of $X'$ after one timestep (and hence one new row has been added); and $F^i_{t+1}(X',t)$ as the latest element of an arbitrary matrix-valued function. As we shall discuss shortly, $F^i_{t+1}(X',t)$ may represent not just operations on deterministic variables, but also on stochastic ones. There is also no requirement for the function to be continuous.

So the basic computational idea here is to iterate the matrix $X$ forward in time by a row, and use its previous version $X'$ as an entire matrix input into a function which populates the elements of its latest rows. Pretty simple! But why go to all this trouble of storing matrix inputs for previous values of the same process? For a large class of stochastic processes this memory of past values is essential to consistently construct the sample paths moving forward. This is true in particular for \emph{non-Markovian} phenomena, where the latest values don't just depend on the immediately previous ones but can depend on values which occured much earlier in the process.

So, now that we've mathematically defined a really general notion of iterating the stochastic process forward in time, it makes sense to discuss some simple examples. For instance, it is frequently possible to split $F$ up into deteministic (denoted $D$) and stochastic (denoted $S$) matrix-valued functions like so
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = D^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) + S^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) \,.
\end{align}
%%
In the case of stochastic processes with continuous sample paths, it's also nearly always the case with mathematical models of real-world systems that the deterministic part will at least contain the term $D^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_t$ because the overall system is described by some stochastic differential equation. This is not a really requirement in our general formalism, however.

What about the stochastic term? For example, if we wanted to consider a \emph{Wiener process noise}, we can define $W^i_{t}$ is a sample from a Wiener process for each of the state dimensions indexed by $i$ and our formalism becomes
%%
\begin{align}
& S^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) =  W^i_{t+1}-W^i_{t} \label{eq:wiener}\,,
\end{align}
%%
where one draws the increments $W^i_{t+1}-W^i_{t}$ from a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a variance equal to the step size in time (for the continuous process one is approximating). Note that for state spaces with dimensions $>1$, we could also allow for non-trivial cross-correlations between the noises in each dimension.

In another example, to model \emph{Geometric Brownian motion noise} we would simply have to multiply $X^i_t$ to the Wiener process like so
%%
\begin{align}
& S^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t}(W^i_{t+1}-W^i_{t})\label{eq:gbm} \,.
\end{align}
%%
Here we have implicitly adopted the Itô interpretation to describe this stochastic integration. Given a carefully-defined integration scheme other interpretations of the noise would also be possible with our formalism too, e.g., Stratonovich\footnote{Which would implictly give $S^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = (X^i_{t+1}+X^i_{t})(W^i_{t+1}-W^i_{t}) / 2$ for Eq.~(\ref{eq:gbm}).} or others within the more general `$\alpha$-family'~\cite{van1992stochastic,risken1996fokker,rog-will-2000}.

Let's now look at a more complicated type of noise. For example, \emph{fractional Brownian motion noise}, where $[B_{H}]_{t}$ is a sample from a fractional Brownian motion process with Hurst exponent $H$. Following Ref.~\cite{decreusefond1999stochastic}, we can simulate this process by first leveraging an extra dimension in our available state space within $X$ to simulate a standard Wiener process and then inserting this into the following computations
%%
\begin{align}
S^{0}_{t+1}(X',t) &= W_{t+1} - W_{t} \\
S^{1}_{t+1}(X',t) &= [B_{H}]_{t+1}-[B_{H}]_{t} \\
[B_{H}]_{t} &= \sum^t_{s'=s} (S^{0}_{t} - S^{0}_{t-s'}) \frac{(t-s')^{H-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma (H+\frac{1}{2})} {}_2F_1 \bigg( H-\frac{1}{2};\frac{1}{2}-H;H+\frac{1}{2};1-\frac{t}{s'}\bigg) \,.
\end{align}
%%

\emph{Generalised continuous noises} would take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t} + g^i_{t+1}(X', W^i_{t+1}-W^i_t, \dots) \,,
\end{align}
%%
where $g^i_{t+1}(X', W^i_{t+1}-W^i_t, \dots)$ is some continuous function of its arguments which can be expanded out with the Itô Lemma.

So far, we have only been discussing noises with continuous sample paths, but our formalism can also adapt to discontinuous sample paths as well. For instance, \emph{jump process noises} generally would take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t)= J^i_{t+1}(X', \dots )\,,
\end{align}
%%
where $J^i_{t+1}(X', \dots )$ are samples from some arbitrary jump process (e.g., compound Poisson) which could generally depend on a variety of inputs, including $X'$. 

\emph{Poisson process noises} would generally take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t} + N^i_{t+1}({\lambda_i})-N^i_{t}({\lambda_i})\,,
\end{align}
%%
where $N^i_{t}({\lambda_i})$ is a sample from a Poisson process with rate $\lambda_i$ for each of the state dimensions indexed by $i$. Note that we may also allow for correlations between the noises in different dimensions.

\emph{Time-inhomogeneous Poisson process noises} would generally take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t} + N^i_{t+1}({\lambda^i_{t+1}})-N^i_{t}({\lambda^i_t}) \,,
\end{align}
%%
where $\lambda^i_{t}$ is a deterministically-varying rate for each of the state dimensions indexed by $i$.

\emph{Cox (doubly-stochastic) process noises} would generally take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t} + N^i_{t+1}({\Lambda^i_{t+1}})-N^i_{t}({\Lambda^i_{t}}) \,,
\end{align}
%%
where the rate $\Lambda^i_{t}$ is now a sample from some continuous-time stochastic process (in the positive-only domain) for each of the state dimensions indexed by $i$.

\emph{Self-exciting process noises} would generally take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = X^i_{t} + N^i_{t+1}[{\cal I}^i_{t+1}(N', \dots)]-N^i_{t}[{\cal I}^i_{t}(N'', \dots)]\,,
\end{align}
%%
where the stochastic rate ${\cal I}^i_{t}(N', \dots)$ now depends on the history of $N'$ explicitly (amongst other potential inputs - see, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkes_process}{Hawkes processes}) for each of the state dimensions indexed by $i$.

\emph{Generalised probabilistic discrete state transitions} would take the form
%%
\begin{align}
& F^{i}_{t+1}(X',t) = T^i_{t+1}(X')\,,
\end{align}
%%
where $T^i_{t+1}(X')$ is a generator of the next state to occupy. This generator uses the current state transition probabilities (which are generally conditional on $X'$) at each new step.

\section{\sffamily Useful analysis concepts}

Before progressing further, it will be helpful to discuss some useful concepts that should help us analyse the system later on. The general stochastic process that we defined with Eq.~(\ref{eq:x-step-def}) also has an implicit \emph{master equation} associated to it which fully describes the time evolution of the probability of $X$. This can be written as
%%
\begin{align}
p_{t+1}(X) &= \int_{\Omega_t}{\rm d}X' p_{t}(X') p_{t+1}(X\vert X',t) \label{eq:master-x-cont} \,,
\end{align}
%%
where we are assuming the state space is continuous in each dimension. But what is $\Omega_t$? You can think of this as just the domain of possible $X'$ inputs into the integral which will depend on the specific stochastic process we are looking at.

Let us now define the probability matrix $P$, with $x$-dependent elements $P^i_{t}(x)$ which just mean the probability of $X^i_t=x$. One can deduce that the latest values of this matrix are updated by a step in time according to
%%
\begin{align}
P^i_{t+1}(x) &= \int_{\Omega_t}{\rm d}X' p_{t}(X') p_{t+1}(F^i_{t+1}|X',t) \delta (x-F^i_{t+1}) \label{eq:master-x-cont-update}\,,
\end{align}
%%
where we have made explicit use of Eq.~(\ref{eq:x-step-def}) and a Dirac delta distribution $\delta$.

Note that analogs of the expressions we have written above exist for discrete state spaces as well. In the case of Eq.~(\ref{eq:master-x-cont}), for instance, we would simply replace the integral with a sum and the schematic would look something like this
%%
\begin{align}
p_{t+1}(X) &= \sum_{\Omega_t} p_t(X') p_{t+1}(X \vert X') \label{eq:master-x-disc} \,.
\end{align}
%%

Another useful concept comes from constructing what we shall call `$V$ states' using the time difference in $X$ like so
%%
\begin{align}
V^{i}_{t+1} &= X^{i}_{t+1} - X^{i}_{t} \label{eq:v-step-def}\,.
\end{align}
%%
Given Eq.~(\ref{eq:v-step-def}), we can see that the following relation between $X$ and $V$ is also valid
%%
\begin{align}
X^{i}_{t} &= X_{s}^{i} + \sum_{s'=s+1}^{t}V_{s'}^{i} \label{eq:x-implicit-solution} \,,
\end{align}
%%
where we have defined $s<t$. The resemblance of the tuple $(X_t, V_t, t)$ to a formal `phase space' will be a useful observation to consider for many systems.


\section{\sffamily Summary of desirable features}

\begin{itemize}
\item{using the learnings from the previous sections looking at specific example processes}
\item{above formalism is so general that it can do anything - so while it shall serve as a useful guide and reference point, it would be good here to go through more of the specific desirable components we want to have access to in the software itself}
\item{it might not always be convenient to have the windowed histories stored as S but some other varying quantity which can be used to construct S? take fractional brownian motion as an example of this! hence, need to provide more possible input histories into S}
\item{want the timestep to have either exponentially-sampled lengths or fixed lengths in time}
\item{formalism already isn't explicit about the choice of deterministic integrator in time}
\item{but also want to be able to choose the stochastic integrator in continuous processes (Itô or Stratonovich?)}
\item{enable correlated noise terms at the sample generator level}
\item{configurable setup of simulations with just yamls + a single .go file defining the terms}
\end{itemize}

\section{\sffamily Software design choices}

Ideally, the stochadex sampler should be designed to try and maintain a balance between performance and flexibility of utilisation.

\section{\sffamily Introduction}

Since the basic game engine will run using the \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex}{stochadex} sampler, the novelties in this project are all in the design of the rugby match model itself. And, in this instance, I'm not especially keen on spending a lot of time doing detailed data analysis to come up with the most realistic values for the parameters that are dreamed up here. Even though this would also be interesting.

One could do this data analysis, for instance, by scraping player-level performance data from one of the excellent websites that collect live commentary data such as \href{https://www.rugbypass.com/}{rugbypass.com} or \href{https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/}{espn.co.uk/rugby}.

This game is primarily a way of testing out the interface of the stochadex for other users to build projects with. This should help to both iron out some of the kinks in the design, as well as prioritise adding some more convenience methods for event-based modelling into its code base.

\section{\sffamily Designing the event simulation engine}

We need to begin by specifying an appropriate event space to live in when simulating a rugby match. It is important at this level that events are defined in quite broadly applicable terms, as it will define the state space available to our stochastic sampler and hence the simulated game will never be allowed to exist outside of it. So, in order to capture the fully detailed range of events that are possible in a real-world match, we will need to be a little imaginative in how we define certain gameplay elements when we move through the space.

The diagrams below sum up what should hopefully work as a decent initial approximation while providing a little context with specific examples of play action.
