\chapter*{Introduction}

In designing automated control algorithms of practical importance to the real world it's common to find that only partial observations of the system state are possible. One needs only to think of the measurement uncertainties in any scientific experiment, the latent demand behind orders in a financial market, the unknown reservoirs of infection for a disease pathogen or even the limits to complete supply chain component observability in recognising just how commonly we find ourselves in this situation. This obscurity can make the learning of algorithms to control these systems using data alone an extreme --- if not sometimes impossible --- challenge, at least without further insight provided by a more domain-specific model.

\emph{Worlds Of Observation} is a book about building more realistic training environments for machine learning algorithms to control these `noisy' systems in the real world. While model-free reinforcement learning is a popular and very powerful approach to generating such algorithms~\cite{sutton2018reinforcement} (especially when there is plenty of data and the system is fully observable), this book will primarily explore how to create environments for control algorithms using a more model-based approach. Those readers who are data scientists, research engineers, statistical programmers or computational scientists may find our mathematically descriptive, yet practically-minded, approach in this book quite interesting and maybe a little different to the usual perspectives.

As can be expected from a book about algorithms, this text accompanies a lot of new open-source scientific software. Most of this code is written in various combinations of Go~\cite{golang}, C++~\cite{c++lang}, Python~\cite{pythonlang} and TypeScript~\cite{typescriptlang}. A major motivation for creating these new tools is to prepare a foundation of code from which to develop new and more complex applications. We also hope that the resulting framework will enable anyone to study new phenomena and explore complex control problems effectively, regardless of their scientific background.

The need to properly test all this software has also provided a wonderful excuse to design a wide variety of simulation environments. Some of these have been chosen specifically from some position of domain knowledge and experience with real-world systems, while others have been chosen simply for the enjoyment of learning something new. We hope that our range of examples nicely illustrates the cross-disciplinary applicability of our algorithmic framework and gives some appealing variety to the reader as well. To explore these simulated systems further, we encourage readers to take a look at WorldsOOp (\href{https://github.com/worldsoop/}{https://github.com/worldsoop/}) --- an open source software ecosystem inspired directly by this book.

To achieve some measure of rigour in our algorithmic approach, an important part of this book is the mathematical framework that it introduces and uses throughout. It seems silly to us that mathematical formalities can obscure the practical computations that a programmer is being asked to implement when reading an equation. So, while we've tried to be as ambitious as possible with the level of technical detail in this book, we've also attempted to write many of the mathematical expressions in a more computer-friendly way where feasible,\footnote{For example, we'll typically be thinking more in terms of `matrices' and less about `operators'.} in contrast with the more conventional formal descriptions. To help with this goal of explainability, we also make use of quite a lot of illustrations and diagrams.

A quick note on the code. All of the software that we describe in this book (including the software which compiles the book itself: \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/worlds-of-observation/}{https://github.com/umbralcalc/worlds-of-observation/}) is shared under a MIT License~\cite{mitlicense} and can be found in one of these public Git repositories:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Chapters 1-5: \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/}{https://github.com/umbralcalc/}}
\item{Chapters 6-10: \href{https://github.com/worldsoop/}{https://github.com/worldsoop/}} 
\end{itemize}
Forking these repositories and submitting pull requests for new features or applications is strongly encouraged too, though we apologise in advance if we don't follow these up very quickly as all of this work has to be conducted independently in free time, outside of work hours.

The book is split into two main parts: {\bfseries\sffamily Part 1}, which details the theoretical background and design of code; and {\bfseries\sffamily Part 2}, which explores all of the applications to realistic examples that we wanted to initially try. We hope you, the reader, really enjoy reading through this book and using the all of the code that was built while writing it. We're very grateful to have been able to make use of all the amazing software written and maintained by the open source community which would otherwise have made this project impossible to achieve.
