{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} The idea here is 

\textcolor{red}{This centralised exchange archetype would make sense in simulations of financial, betting and housing markets as well as other forms of resource exchange.}

\item{Inference model: spatial mean field inference features using the probabilistic reweighting }
\item{Also use the likelihood-free inference model?}
