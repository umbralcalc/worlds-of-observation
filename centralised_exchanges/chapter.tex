\chapter{\sffamily Centralised exchanges}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} Defining an archetype simulation environment for centralised exchanges. In our classification scheme, this archetype is defined by an bidirectional star state partition graph topology and would make sense for simulations of financial, betting and housing markets as well as other forms of resource exchange.
