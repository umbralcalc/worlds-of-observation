\section{\sffamily Adapting the probabilistic formalism}

The extra detail that's needed here is to consider how we encode a 2d spatial process into our state vector, and how the elements of the resulting state vector might be correlated to one another depending on their spatial proximity. If we start with a Markovian Gaussian random field, we can derive the Mat\'{e}rn kernel over these spatial coordinates in order to correlate the state vectors in such a way.
