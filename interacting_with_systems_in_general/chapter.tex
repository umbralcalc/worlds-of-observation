\chapter{\sffamily Interacting with systems in general}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} To design and build a generalised concept of interacting with stochastic processes of any kind. The mathematical formalism and software that we introduce here will serve as a common language and interface for any simulation studies into manipulating real world phenomena, and should enable the learning of control algorithms. We will call this software `dexetera', since it originates as an extension to the stochadex. For the mathematically-inclined, this chapter will cover how dexetera is structured in theory by developing some useful extensions to the stochadex formalism and illustrating with some simple examples. For the programmers, the public Git repository for the code described in this chapter can be found here: \href{https://github.com/umbralcalc/dexetera}{https://github.com/umbralcalc/dexetera}.
