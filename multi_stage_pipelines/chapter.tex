\chapter{\sffamily Multi-stage pipelines}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} Defining an archetype simulation environment for multi-stage pipelines. In our classification scheme, this archetype is defined by an arbitrary, directional state partition graph topology and would make sense for simulations of logistics problems or data processing pipelines.
