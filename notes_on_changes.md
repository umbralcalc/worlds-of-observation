# Change Proposal

**Diffusing Ideas: Building control algorithms in a world of noisy systems**

These are notes on large potential changes to the manuscript and purpose of the book.

The idea is to try and focus more on stochastic control problems in the real world as the ultimate point of the book. This will give a natural following from the RL branch of data science and also gives more real-world impact. 

Tangible changes proposed:

* Split the manuscript into two main parts:
  * Part 1: Theory and software design
  * Part 2: Real-world applications
* Part 1 chapters:
  * Building a generalised simulator
  * Empirical probabilistic reweighting
  * Generalised MAP inference: featuring Libtorch/Gotch-based amortized simulation inference
  * Interacting with systems in general
  * Optimising actions for control objectives
  * Could be another one or two here?? 
* Part 2 chapters:
  * Angling for freshwater fish: clear data and example
  * Managing a rugby match: no need to make a game
  * Influencing house prices: simulate the UK economy
  * Resource allocation for epidemics: pretty obvious this one
  * Algo-trading on financial markets: pretty clear
  * Sequential (experiment and UX) design problems as multi-armed bandits: pretty clear
  * Controlling some 2D spatial system: figure out this one
  * Controlling the state of hydrodynamic systems: figure out this one
  * Quantum control? .... think up loads more!!!
