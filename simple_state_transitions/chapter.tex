\chapter{\sffamily Simple state transitions}

{\bfseries\sffamily Concept.} Defining an archetype simulation environment for simple state transitions. In our classification scheme, this archetype is defined by a trivial state partition graph topology and would make sense for simulations of sequential design, sports matches and other simple gameplay domains.
